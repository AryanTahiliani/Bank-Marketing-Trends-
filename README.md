# Bank-Marketing-Trends-
This project explores bank marketing campaign data to uncover patterns behind customer conversions — understanding what drives people to subscribe to a term deposit.
I used Python to clean, visualize, and model the data, identifying the key factors that influence campaign success.

Project Overview:

The goal was to study how marketing efforts perform across customer groups and campaigns.
By analyzing past data, I aimed to find which attributes (like age, job type, contact method, or campaign duration) affect a customer’s decision to say “yes”.

Main steps:

1. Loaded and cleaned the Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI repository format)

2. Performed EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations

3. Visualized key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

4. Built classification models to predict campaign outcomes

5. Evaluated model performance and explained results in business terms

Skills & Tools: 
Category	       Tools
Language:	       Python 3
Libraries:	     Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn
Techniques:	     EDA, feature encoding, correlation analysis, classification
Environment: 	   Google Colab 

Highlights:

1. Discovered top customer profiles most likely to respond to marketing calls

2. Found which contact channels and campaign durations yield better results

3. Built a baseline predictive model (Logistic Regression)

4. Visualized customer behavior with interactive plots

What I Learned:

This project strengthened my ability to:

1. Translate raw marketing data into clear, visual insights

2. Apply classification models to real-world business problems

3. Communicate analytical results in a business-focused, non-technical way
